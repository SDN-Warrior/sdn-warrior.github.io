      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I have been asked several times on LinkedIn for an article on the topic of brownfield upgrades from VCF 5 to VCF 9.&#xA;Well, here we are. I thought it would be relatively easy and that you could just click your way through, but I was wrong.&#xA;But let&amp;rsquo;s start at the beginning.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As things stand at the moment, if you have NSX version newer then 4.2.1.3 in your VCF environment, here&amp;rsquo;s the bad newsâ€”it&amp;rsquo;s not possible as of today.&#xA;NSX 4.2.1.4 and newer has a newer code base than NSX 9.0.0.0 and is therefore not compatible. The problem should be fixed with VCF 9.0.1.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Broadcom is currently changing the access to their public repo. This affects many products. Affected are vCenter, ESXi Updates, vSAN File Services and of course VCF.&#xA;The changes are far-reaching. The repo URL has changed and also the way it can be accessed. With the username and password of the Broadcom account, access will no longer work from April 23, 2025. Time to take a look at the whole thing.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
