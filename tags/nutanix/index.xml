      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In November 2025, I was a guest at Nutanix Next in Darmstadt, where I met up with old colleagues and wanted to take a look at what Nutanix had to offer. Visitors were kindly given the opportunity to obtain certification on the spot, which I naturally took advantage of.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;source srcset=&#34;https://sdn-warrior.org/nutanix-ce/01_hu_f9ca88236445953f.jpg&#34; type=&#34;image/jpeg&#34;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;          &lt;img&#xD;&#xA;            src=&#34;https://sdn-warrior.org/nutanix-ce/01_hu_f9ca88236445953f.jpg&#34;alt=&#34;Yes, this is my happy face&#34;width=&#34;1988&#34;&#xD;&#xA;            height=&#34;1491&#34;/&gt;&#xD;&#xA;        &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yes, this is my happy face&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Having worked with VMware for over 20 years, I was naturally skeptical about what Nutanix could do, and what can I say, the differences are perhaps less than I thought. You could also say same, same but different—at least when it comes to the core of virtualization. Nutanix is based on KVM, which is rock solid and which I have been running in my home lab for ages in the form of Unraid. When it comes to storage, Nutanix takes a different approach and primarily relies on HCI and its own storage solution.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
