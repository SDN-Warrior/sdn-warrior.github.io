      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;certificates--the-mother-of-all-evils&#34;&gt;Certificates – the mother of all evils&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In the last 25 years of working in IT, I have never met anyone who is happy when certificates expire and need to be replaced – quite the opposite, in fact.&#xA;Certificates are like printers: everyone hates them, but we need them.&#xA;Fortunately, VCF and VCF9 have greatly simplified the entire procedure.&#xA;In this article, I would like to briefly explain how you can use VCF Operations and a Microsoft CA to exchange certificates easily and, in some cases, automatically – guaranteed pain-free.&#xA;However, it is still not an enjoyable process.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
